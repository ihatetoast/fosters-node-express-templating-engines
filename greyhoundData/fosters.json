Bubbles was born in early 2018 and is possibly a greyhound mix.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived we were able to get her straight to the vet for evaluation. It was determined that a dental was the most important procedure to tackle first. She is resting comfortably in a wonderful foster home. It will be a while before Bubbles is available, she has to wait to be spayed until late October.","isCatsafe":"Is not cat safe"}]
