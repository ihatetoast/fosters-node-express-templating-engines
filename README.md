# Fosters Registration App

## What

Not really an app, but an excuse to play with templating engines, especially ones I'm less familiar with (Pug, EJS). The idea is that an admin would register a foster with name, description, a photo, etc., but in this case these fosters already exist at [Greyhound Adoption League of Texas](https://galtx.org/) (GALT). 

## Why

Playing with Node and Express. Getting lovey dovey with templating engines. I don't see this as ever being finished because I see myself wanting to add fields or switch which views have which templates to practice. I often used Pug on Codepen for PureCSS images fun but never really knew how to use it properly. The indentation is great for the PureCSS images, but I have never dealt with it the way it should be.

Each view will have a Pug, EJS, and Handlebars version. The engine used can be changed in `app.set('view engine', '...')` so I can play Hera and change it willy nilly to play. 

## But whatabout 

Styling? Yeah, I'll fiddle faddle piddle paddle with that when the mood hits and I get time to binge watch Supernatural. This is for Node/Express and templating engines. Styling this is for zoning out.
